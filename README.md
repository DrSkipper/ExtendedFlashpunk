ExtendedFlashpunk
=================

Some classes and packages which extend the functionality of the Flashpunk game engine.

Features
-----------------

* Powerful UI system
* Fully functional Camera
* Local data storage
* Extended Console and Input functionality (Controller Support coming soon)
* Some utility and helper classes

Requirements
-----------------
This project extends and heavily utilizes much of the [Flashpunk](http://useflashpunk.net/) engine, which is included as a submodule in this repository, but must be manually added to the classpaths/sourcepaths of your project. Alternatively, you can link your own version of Flashpunk in your classpaths/sourcepaths.
